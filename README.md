## Why?

I hypothesized that DevOps and Agile had an adversarial relationship with each
other. This was funny to me given that DevOps and Agile are sides of the same
cloth for me.

Since I was asked to talk about "DevOps and Agile," I figured "Why not talk
about the top five things that DevOps practitioners absolutely hate?"

I could have gone with my gut and listed the top five things I personally
dislike about Agile, but thought "but what does the Internet think?"

From that, this project was born.
