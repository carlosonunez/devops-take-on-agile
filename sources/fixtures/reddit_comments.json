There's endless, endless complaining here and everywhere about agile catastrophes. I thought for a while I was doing kanban (and I'd read on it for a while, etc.), and later I discovered I was missing some basic principles of that. And I also thought for a good while that gating PRs was CI.\n\nThis perversion of terms is more harmful than it appears. It hinders communication, leading to confusion. And what's worse, when most people don't know what devops, agile, CI/CD, Kanban, etc. are, it means they cannot get the benefits they bring.\n\nWe should try to use terms correctly.\n\nTo the OP:\n\n&gt; If you have manual processes, button clicks and change approval boards, merging to the release branch, you are NOT Continuously Delivering.\n\nAnd you're not necessarily doing CI either.\n\n I see Continuous Integration/Delivery/Deployment as a continuum:\n\n* Continuous Integration: you don't have long-lived WIP branches, but you don't try to keep your main branch releaseable at all times (you might branch off release branches to stabilize, you might have release freezes, etc.). People merge as soon as possible when they have *something*.\n* If you don't have long-lived WIP branches and you keep your main branch releaseable at all times, then you're doing continuous delivery, but you still have explicit releases (basically you name a commit in the main branch the new version regularly).\n* If you do all of the above, and release every single commit (or with an automatic elevated cadence- I would say daily or faster), then you are doing continuous deployment.\n\nSome stuff is a little bit fuzzy (what's a long-lived branch?) , but I think it's a reasonably clear, brief and usable description.\n\nWhile I'm at it...\n\n* DevOps: your dev and ops guy work together, with the same objectives. No bureaucracy and you optimize for lead times across dev and ops tasks (e.g. you treat developing a feature and deploying it as the same task; only the wall time to do both matters; if you develop fast, but then it takes a lot of time to deploy, this is not OK, or somebody else's problem. Conversely, if the software developed creates messes for operations, that's not OK either, nor somebody else's problem..)\n* Agile: this includes stuff like moving towards continuous deployment and planning very iteratively. You have long term goals, but you break stuff into small deliverables so you have fast feedback cycles.\n\nI think if we managed to adopt this consistently, things would be better. Of course, organizations want to be seen as adopting the last fads. I know we already point at those and laugh. They just need to hear that laughter more.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1664622299,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"iqm0muu","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_xsja83","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":40789227179,"permalink":"/r/devops/comments/xsja83/can_we_stop_lumping_in_cd_with_ci/iqm0muu/","retrieved_utc":1664622311,"score":1,"score_hidden":true,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"devops","subreddit_id":"t5_2rzmn","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null,"updated_utc":1667422343,"body_sha1":"8c89c74b1bad97a4b3eab243264944fbde332df3","utc_datetime_str":"2022-10-01 11:04:59"},{"all_awardings":[],"archived":false,"associated_award":null,"author":"geburah","author_created_utc":1261479927,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_3saq1","author_is_blocked":false,"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"body":"Because devops is not meant to be a position, but a certain way of working, not localised in a single person or team.  \n\n\nBasically, you are a sysadmin, system engineer, developer, architect, tester, etc. And your teams use devops, agile, TDD, to do you job.\n\nYou don't DO devops ( that is actually absurd ), you practice devops on what you do. \n\nOr in another way devops would be how you do what you do.\n\n[https://devops.com/devops-is-not-a-role-its-a-culture/](https://devops.com/devops-is-not-a-role-its-a-culture/)\n\nSadly it is a term that became a buzzword and now almost meaningless.  \n\n\nWatch this: [https://youtu.be/3KpPBnEtRj4](https://youtu.be/3KpPBnEtRj4)\n\nBefore the term was bastardized.

It is important to have a technical path in mind and be transparent with it to your employer, even if he might not be able to fully accommodate it for the current or future projects. Best case scenario he finds you a project that matches your expectations in the future, worse case scenario says can't do but helps you get some trainings in that direction + he understands your position. (you don't want him to think that you are enjoying what you are doing when you aren't).\n\nMy recommendations in terms of technical path:\n\n1. Start with the AWS Solution Architect path instead of AWS DevOps. It covers all the other paths and grants you a better overall understanding. As a Cloud Solution Architect I use all the solutions that you have mentioned (Terraform, AWS, Ansible) and even if you don't like this specific role, it is still the most desired AWS certification.\n2. In terms of CI/CD as a DevOps it is OK to get bored of it but you should be able to design a good pipeline foundation. Rest is just value to your company and maintenance. To me, 80% of CI/CD is just processes, methodology and organisation theory anyways. (devops, agile, project management etc). The rest is about provisioning your users with an UI for your automations. As a DevOps your main value in knowing that theory + what/how to automate. \n3. In terms of Development, it is fine to not like it but you should be able to script well in a language (python/TS I would recommend) + bash or powershell. The scripting language comes very handy when you want to use AWS CDK or something like Pulumi.

Sociologists define cultures generally on a spectrum from loose to tight (e.g. The US is loose whereas Japan is tight). We can borrow this concept and classify industries or the work environments as tight or loose. \n\nIndustries that tend to be governed by rigid contracts such as construction would be very tight and some in-house software tool project to be used by 10 or so people would be considered very loose. But that's not absolute. You can have tight projects in a typically loose industry and vice versa. It has more to do with whether or not contracts are involved, how many of them there are and how the terms/specs are written. Case in point, if you've worked on government contracts you would know more often than not waterfall is still the most common way software projects get built, especially software projects that are part of bigger projects that involve other things, so there's not a whole lot of opportunity to be devops-y or even agile. On the other hand, an analog to devops/agile already sort of exists in construction and it's called design-build as opposed to the more conventional design-bid-build approach. It brings the designers and builders together and is supposed to reduce cost and shorten build time on paper. In reality though, it makes things difficult to price for contractors and coordination is very difficult when you have to get multiple trades involved. Companies in this industry have a hard time keeping track of things with one set of drawings, when you throw version control into the mix, 95% of the people get lost two revs down the road. I don't want to call people dumb but trust me when I say they're not the sharpest knives in the drawer.\n\nI would follow this train of thought and try to identify industries with a loose environment to start.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1660011318,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"ijizewb","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_wjccxw","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":40359622586,"permalink":"/r/devops/comments/wjccxw/using_devops_skills_and_principals_in_other/ijizewb/","retrieved_utc":1660011329,"score":1,"score_hidden":true,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"devops","subreddit_id":"t5_2rzmn","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null,"updated_utc":1667844009,"body_sha1":"2db8cbefc75d8e7f86fd587f06b3cff85be5b47a","utc_datetime_str":"2022-08-09 02:15:18"}],"error":null,"metadata":{"es":{"took":488,"timed_out":false,"num_reduce_phases":2,"_shards":{"total":832,"successful":832,"skipped":0,"failed":0},"hits":{"total":{"value":16,"relation":"eq"},"max_score":null}},"es_query":{"size":5,"query":{"bool":{"must":[{"bool":{"must":[{"simple_query_string":{"fields":["body"],"query":"\"devops agile\"","default_operator":"and"}}]}},{"bool":{"should":[{"match":{"subreddit":"devops"}}],"minimum_should_match":1}}]}},"aggs":{},"sort":{"created_utc":"desc"}},"es_query2":"{\"size\":5,\"query\":{\"bool\":{\"must\":[{\"bool\":{\"must\":[{\"simple_query_string\":{\"fields\":[\"body\"],\"query\":\"\\\"devops agile\\\"\",\"default_operator\":\"and\"}}]}},{\"bool\":{\"should\":[{\"match\":{\"subreddit\":\"devops\"}}],\"minimum_should_match\":1}}]}},\"aggs\":{},\"sort\":{\"created_utc\":\"desc\"}}","api_launch_time":1678372543.8929312,"api_request_start":1678413868.8579907,"api_request_end":1678413869.3781722,"api_total_time":0.52018141746521}}
